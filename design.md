1. Characters
   1. Base statistics determine damage floor
   2. Normal attacks (Charged and Plunging) and Skills scale off of these stats
   3. They can hold weapons and other items that provide buffs to these stats or other aspects of their damage output
   4. These buffs usually last for a limited time or have specific conditions to apply.
3. Teams
   1.
5. Enemies
